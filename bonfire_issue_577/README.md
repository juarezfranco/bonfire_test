# bonfire_test

This project was created specifically to demonstrate a collision issue in the Bonfire framework. It includes a minimal setup where different object shapes (rectangle, circle, and polygon) are assigned the collision class using Tiled.

While rectangle collisions work as expected, circle and polygon objects do not behave correctly. The project highlights this inconsistency by rendering the collision areas but showing that the player does not respect the boundaries of circle and polygon objects.

The project serves as a reproducible example to assist in identifying and resolving the issue in the Bonfire framework.
